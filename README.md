## How long will my taxi trip take in NYC?
This repo contains the source code for the flask app [NYC Taxi Trip Duration](https://nyc-taxi-trip.herokuapp.com/) 
that predicts taxi trip durations with an AI model deployed in simple and quick interface.
Its development is based on [this research](https://www.kaggle.com/qshick/nyc-taxi-trips) using NYC Open Data which includes 1.4+ millions of taxi trips.
The model receives pickup/dropoff points from users that leads to 135 inputs including external data such as current weather requested via API, 
and prediction is made for the departure from now.
